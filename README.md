# El rinc√≥n de la Curuba

This is the Capstone Project for the Web Application Development Program. This project was developed by [Laura Gomez](https://elenagoto.ch/), as a final step to complete the full program of the [**My Digital Future Fellowship**](https://www.mydigitalfuture.ch/), and was defended and approved in December 2020.

The main goal of this project is to put into practice the knowledge I have acquired while completing the 4 courses included in the Program:

1. HTML and CSS
2. Interactive web pages
3. Introduction to Ruby on Rails
4. Dynamic web applications

The app has been deployed in Heroku to the following URL: [https://rincon-de-la-curuba.herokuapp.com](https://rincon-de-la-curuba.herokuapp.com).

## The "Rincon de la Curuba" app

"Rincon de la Curuba" was imagined as a blog where the colombian podcasters creators of the "El olor de la Curuba Podcast" would be able to share their written content, as well as the episodes of their podcasts.

The application was developped using the following conpcepts and technologies:

### HTML & CSS

- HTML5
- CSS and SASS
- Atomic design
- BEM

### JavaScript

- Vanilla JavaScript.
- Asynchronous requests.
- External JS libraries ([Choices.js](https://joshuajohnson.co.uk/Choices/)).

### Ruby on Rails

- Databases associations.
- Automated tests.
- Authetication and authorizations.
- Locales.
